# Shipping Container Optimizer (Fall 2023 Hackathon)

Welcome to Team G14's Hackathon Solution!

Our team is sponsored by GPC/ NAPA.

Our challenge was to find the ideal shipping container for any type of bulk order. We had the optional, added challenege of taking extra parameters, such as sales forcast and cost, into account.

Our solution works by allowing the user to enter their own order or calculate an optimal order based on sales forcast, then searches for the container that will "ship the least amount of air."

We also ask the user if the container is being used for storage or travel, and how many miles it will go if it is being shipped. 

Once the best-fit container is determined, it will also show the cheapest container, so the user can choose which option works best for them.

To showcase what our solution could be in the future, we created a draft in Figma, which can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/6TPZpzIK4LJzRXiv56ywk2/Container-Optamizer?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=chC56czygmI69ONR-1).

[F23Hackathon](F23Hackathon) contains the code used for our solution, as well as a default order for those who want to test it out without inputing information.

[Presentation.pdf](Presentation.pdf) contains our solution presentation, which came with a live demonstration.


Please Note:

This solution was made in ~48 hours and serves as a first-draft/ mock-up. For this reason we had to make certain assumptions and estimations for things like cost, size, and weight.

Some equations may also be inaccurate. For this solution, we assumed all containers/ pallets/ items would be a rectange, but we understand that some items might have more complex shapes that weren't taken into account.
